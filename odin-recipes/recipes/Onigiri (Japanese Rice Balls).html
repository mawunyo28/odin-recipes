    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Onigiri, also known as omusubi, nigirimeshi, or rice ball, is a Japanese food made from white rice formed into
        triangular or cylindrical shapes and often wrapped in nori.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
        <li>5 ½ cups water, divided</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup bonito shavings (dry fish flakes)</li>
        <li>2 sheets nori (dry seaweed), cut into 1/2-inch strips</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>STEPS</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Wash rice in a mesh strainer until water runs clear. Combine washed rice and 4 1/2 cups water in a
                saucepan.<br> Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low; cover, and simmer
                rice until water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.<br> Let rice rest for 15 minutes to continue to steam and
                become tender. Allow cooked rice to cool.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Combine remaining 1 cup water with salt in a small bowl; use to dampen hands before handling rice. Divide
                cooked rice into 8 equal portions.<br> Use one portion of rice for each onigiri.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Divide one portion of rice in two. Create a dimple in rice and fill with a heaping teaspoon of bonito
                flakes.<br> Cover with remaining portion of rice and press lightly to enclose filling inside rice ball.
                Gently press rice to shape into a triangle; wrap with a strip of nori and sprinkle with sesame seeds.<br>
                Repeat with remaining portions of rice.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
